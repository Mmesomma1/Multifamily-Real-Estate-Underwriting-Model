### 1. **Property & Acquisition Overview**

* **Total Units:** 120
* **Purchase Price:** \$12,000,000
* **Closing Costs:** \$350,000
* **Total Acquisition Cost:** \$12,350,000
  This is the capital required before financing and improvements.

---

### 2. **Financing Structure**

* **Loan Amount:** \$8,400,000
* **Interest Rate:** 4.5%
* **Amortization Term:** **(Needs correction)** – currently shows `3000%`, likely a data entry error. Should be something like **30 years**.
* **Equity Required:** \$12,350,000 – \$8,400,000 = **\$3,950,000**

---

### 3. **Income Assumptions**

* **Monthly Rent per Unit:** \$1,250
* **Effective Occupancy Rate:** 95%
* **Vacancy Rate:** 5%

> 🔸 **Effective Gross Rent:**
> \$1,250 x 120 units x 95% occupancy = **\$142,500/month**
> Annualized: \$142,500 x 12 = **\$1,710,000**

However, a different **Gross Rent of \$157,895/month** is shown. This suggests:

* Possibly **miscellaneous income** is added.
* Or, a typo – reconciliation needed for consistency.

---

### 4. **Operating Expenses**

* **Operating Ratio:** 35%
* **Operating Expenses:** \$55,263 (matches 35% of \$157,895)

> 🔸 **NOI (Net Operating Income):** \$157,895 - \$55,263 = **\$102,632/month**
> Annualized: **\$1,231,584**

---

### 5. **CapEx (Capital Expenditures)**

* **Budget:** \$500,000
  Allocated for renovations, value-add, or property improvements.

---

### 6. **Exit Assumptions**

* **Hold Period:** 5 Years
* **Exit Cap Rate:** 5.5%

> 🔸 **Exit Valuation:**
> NOI / Cap Rate = \$1,231,584 / 5.5% = **\$22,392,436**
> This represents the projected sale price in year 5.

---

## 🧩 Strategic Insights

* **Leverage** is approximately **68% LTV**, moderate and manageable.
* **NOI Margin:** \~65% of Gross Rent (strong operational efficiency).
* **Value Creation:** With a \$12.35M acquisition and \$22.39M projected exit, this model potentially doubles investor capital (depending on exit assumptions and costs).
* **Exit Cap Rate** being lower than market average increases valuation; keep conservative if modeling risks.
